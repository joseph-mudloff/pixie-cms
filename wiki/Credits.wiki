Pixie uses code from many other open source projects on the web. Without these projects Pixie would not be as great as it is today. We would like to say big thanks to the following projects:

==== Development ====

  * [http://www.bad-behavior.ioerror.us Bad Behavior] - A fantastic anti-spam script.
  * [http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/ TinyMCE by Moxiecode] - Cross-platform WYSIWYG editor.
  * [http://jquery.com/ jQuery] - Simply the best JavaScript library!
  * [http://www.phpclasses.org/browse/package/2779.html MySQL Backup] - A nice lightweight and easy to use backup class by Vagharshak Tozalakyan.
