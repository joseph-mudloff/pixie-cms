Pixie is not out to compete with any other site management tool, the main goal is to keep Pixie so simple that even your Grandma could use it. Keeping Pixie simple does not stop it from having plenty of useful features, lets start with our favourite three:

=== The Top Three ===
----

==== The Installer ====

    Most website management tools will install the same package for everyone. Pixie takes a new approach and allows you to select the type of site you are after. A blog?, Band? or Business? you choose what best suits you. As Pixie matures so will the list of possibilities...

==== Web Standards ====

    Pixie uses the latest web standards so your site is accessible to all your visitors and is search engine friendly.  Pixie is especially fond of [http://microformats.org/ Microformats]. It is not just the visitors that benefit though, we are working hard to make the administration area accessible too.

==== Design ====

    Pixie itself has been designed to be simple. Pixie’s interface has been refined over a number of versions to be user friendly. On the visitor side... you will love the fact that all you need to know is CSS to customise your site. If that sounds too complicated you can choose from the ever increasing amount of [http://www.getpixie.co.uk/downloads/ free themes]. 

=== The Complete Features List ===
----

==== Clean URLs ====

    Ugly dynamic URLs are a thing of the past, Pixie supports clean, search engine friendly URLs.

==== CSS themes ====

    Pixie currently uses CSS for its templates, think that is restrictive? look at [http://www.csszengarden.com/ CSS Zen Garden] for inspiration and see how powerful CSS can be. For a quick site refresh why not download [http://www.getpixie.co.uk/downloads/ extra themes] available from the Pixie site.

==== Database backups ====

    Your site data is important so we figured it would be nice to back it up once in a while. Pixie offers support for this to help protect against any unplanned incidents.

==== File manager with tag support ====

    Upload your files into Pixie and tag them for easy sorting. 

==== Free & Open Source ====

    Pixie is free (as in cost) and free (as in what you can do with it). Pixie is released under GPL v3 which means:

  * You can use Pixie free of charge.
  * You can redistribute it without any limitations.
  * You can make modifications and while they are used internally. If you start distribution of modified system you need to make modification publicly available under the terms of General Public License.
  * You can’t charge for the software itself even if it is modified. 

==== jQuery ====

    I used to hate programming Javascript until I met jQuery. We bundle the latest version of jQuery with Pixie so you can make use of it in your own site.

==== Microformats ====

    Microformats are excellent... etc...

==== Modules, Themes, Plug-ins and Blocks ====

    Make Pixie do more with downloadable extras. Browse the ever increasing extras section on the Pixie website.

==== Multilingual ====

    Pixie has support for different languages (although none have been translated yet...).

==== No limits ====

    Pixie does not impose any limits on your site, you can have as many pages, files, posts and users as you require.

==== Portable ====

    Run Pixie from your local machine or memory pen and use it as a design development tool.

==== Quick to develop for ====
    So you want Pixie to do more? Then its time to program your own module. Pixie makes this easy by looking at the database tables for your module and automatically creating the admin interface. All you need to code is what he public see. Details are in the documentation. 

==== Robots.txt ====

    Pixie protects certain folders with a robots file, this should help prevent your files and images showing up in web searches and then subsequently being hot-linked.

==== RSS 2.0 ====

    Let visitors subscribe to the blogs and news pages you create via RSS. Pixie also has RSS feeds available to the administrators for keeping an eye on your site.

==== Search Engine Friendly ====

    Etc........

==== Sitemap.xml ====

    All the major search engines are now looking for a sitemap.xml file. Pixie supplies one as standard so you don’t have to worry about yet another standard.

==== Small ====

   Pixie is just a few megabytes in size, we always wanted to keep the size of the software small it could run quietly and efficiently on your server.

==== Spam Protected ====
    
    We all hate spam... and so does Pixie. Pixes uses the excellent Bad Behaviour script to keep your site Spam free. 

==== System and referral logs ====

    Keep track of Pixie and your latest visitors with Pixe’s built in stats system.

==== User support with privileges ====

    Need help managing your site? you can add more users and allow them to perform different tasks with privileges.

==== Web Based ====

    You can install Pixie on your own server so you have full control over your own site and data. Pixie will work through most major browsers (we recommend Firefox) giving you control over your site from anywhere in the world.

==== XHTML compatible rich text editor ====
    That sounds posh!... and it is. Pixie uses TinyMce to add a simple word processing interface so editing your text is simple and familiar.
