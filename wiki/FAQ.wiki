=== Your Questions ===
----

==== What do I need to run Pixie? ====

  * A Web Server that supports PHP (version 4.3.0 and above), MySQL (version 4.0 and above) and a !JavaScript enabled web browser. More information is available on the [Installation] wiki page.

==== How do I use Pixie? ====

  * If you find you are having trouble getting around the Pixie interface or you simply want a section explained then download our PDF user guide. The guide gives you step by step instructions on how to perform different tasks within Pixie.

==== What licence is Pixie released under? ====

  * Pixie is released under the [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html GNU General Public License, version 3]. 

==== How much does it cost? ====
  
  * Pixie is free and always will be. We are considering ways we can monetise the project in the future without charging for Pixie itself. This will ensure we can afford the time it takes to develop the software. At the moment we are considering creating an area on the Pixie homepage called "Pixie Pro" which will give paying users (approx Â£10($20) a year) access to exclusive themes, modules and plug-ins. If you submit your own themes, modules and plug-ins into "Pixie Pro" you will be given a year free for every item submitted... sound good? We think so! 

==== What is open source? ====

  * To learn more about open source software we suggest you visit the [http://opensource.org/docs/osd Open Source Initiative homepage].
 
==== What is a CMS (content management system)? ====
