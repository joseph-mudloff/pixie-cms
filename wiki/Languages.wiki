#summary Translation of Pixie into new languages
#labels language,development

Pixie offers basic support for languages. We are currently looking for people to help translate the core English file into other languages. The core file contains all the text strings from within Pixie. If you would like to help out please get in touch via the forums.

We are also open for discussion on ways in which language support can be improved. For example we would like to offer a multi-lingual installer and build in support for right to left languages. If you can help with these areas please get in touch.
