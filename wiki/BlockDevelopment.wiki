#summary How to develop new blocks for Pixie.
#labels Phase-Implementation,blocks,development,php

Blocks are small chunks of content that sit beside your pages, at the moment you need to edit and create blocks manually. You will find your blocks in the blocks (admin/blocks/) folder, Pixie comes with a number of examples to get you started. Example blocks include:

  * A [http://www.flickr.com Flickr] badge.
  * A [http://www.digg.com Digg] badge.
  * An [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format) RSS feed].

We are currently looking at ways to make block handling much easier from within the Pixie interface. If you have any ideas on how we could do this please share them in the [http://groups.google.com/group/pixie-cms/ forums].

=== Block development ===
----

Blocks can contain PHP, HTML, JavaScript and CSS. Think of them as tiny web pages that can re-used across your site, over and over again. To create your own block you will need to create a PHP file that starts with "block_----", for this example lets make a block that contains a shopping list. The file I create is called "block_shopping_list.php".

This block is very simple and is made only from HTML. Lets take a look at the code (the comments are to help you understand the structure of blocks):
