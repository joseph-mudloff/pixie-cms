Installing Pixie manually is actually easier than it sounds, here is how you do it:

=== Manual Installation ===
----

==== Create your config.php file: ====
   In the admin folder of your Pixie download you will find a file called config.php. This file stores your database information. You will need to copy and paste the following code into the file replacing the information here with your own database information supplied by your web host.

{{{

// MySQL settings //
$pixieconfig['db'] = 'my_database_name';
$pixieconfig['user'] = 'my_database_username';
$pixieconfig['pass'] = 'my_database_password';

// These should be ok to leave as they are //
$pixieconfig['host'] = 'localhost';
$pixieconfig['table_prefix'] = '';
?>
}}} 

==== Create your .htaccess file:==== 
   The .htaccess file is an invisible file that is used to create the Clean URLs that Pixie uses. This file normally only works on Linux hosting platforms (some Windows servers do now support it). In the root of your website you will need to create a new file named .htaccess. Copy the following code into it and edit where indicated:

{{{

# These two lines allow you to upload larger files to Pixie (up to 100mb). 
php_value upload_max_filesize "100M"
php_value post_max_size "100M"

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
   
  RewriteEngine On

  # The RewriteBase should be set to the folder of your installation: 
  # / = your site is in the root, e.g. www.mysite.com 
  # /mysite = a site installed in a folder called mysite, e.g. www.mysite.com/mysite/
  
  RewriteBase /
  
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteRule ^(.*) index.php?%{QUERY_STRING} [L]

</IfModule>
}}}

==== Import the SQL from manual.sql: ==== 
  Pixie requires some MySQL tables to be setup in order to run. In the install folder within Pixie (admin/install) you will find a file named: manual.sql. Use your favoruite database management program (such as [http://www.phpmyadmin.net/ phpMyAdmin]) to import this sql file into your database.

==== Make your upload folders writeable: ====
   In the admin folder of your Pixie download you will find a file called config.php. This file stores your datab
