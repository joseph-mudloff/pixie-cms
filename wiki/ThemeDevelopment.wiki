Making themes for Pixie is easy, anyone with knowledge of
CSS will be able to create a theme. Pixie was created with the same philosophy as the [http://www.csszengarden.com/ CSS Zen Garden]: 

     A quote about the CSS zen Garden and how it works

You could call Pixie the "CMS Zen Garden".

=== Starting your design ===

A Graphic design tutorial is beyond the scope of this document, the main point I want to get across here is that you should visualise your site however you feel comfortable. Personally I build all my website designs in Photoshop. Whatever applications you use, make sure you can easily save smaller slices of your design into web compatible image formats (.jpg, .gif and .png).

To make life simple we have created a theme template which contains the files you need to get your theme started. The template can be downloaded here.

The template is broken into a number of files, each of which are explained below:   

  * *settings.php*
  This is your starting point for the template, it has plenty of
  helpful comments to get you started. This file lets Pixie know
  about your theme.

  * *core.css*
  The core css file resets the css and lays out new base styles 
  for most html elements. As a rule you should not need to add 
  or remove any selectors in this file, just edit the values. 
		
  * *layout.css* 
  This file is where you place your page layouts.
	
  * *dynamic.css* 
  This file is for all your blog/dynamic page css.
	
  * *navigation.css*
  This file is for your sites navigation style.

  * *print.css*
  A basic print style has been supplied, place your own print 
  style in this file.

  * *404.css* 
  This file styles your custom 404 page.

  * *ie6.css/ie7.css* 
  These files are used to store IE6 and IE7 specific styles.
  These two files are not required an can removed if not used
  in your theme.

  * *handheld.css*
  This css file is used to create a stylesheet compatible with
  mobile devices. This file is not required and can be removed
  if it is not used as part of your theme.

  * *favicon.ico*
  The favicon for your theme.

  * *thumb.jpg*
  A preview thumbnail if your theme.  

  * */images/*
  The images folder is where you store your theme graphics and
  icons. We have supplied you a free icon pack called "bitsie"
  that you may use within your theme. "bitsie" has two
  variations; light and dark and are released under the:
  Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 UK: England & Wales Licence.
