= Coding Standards =

== Short Tags `<? ... ?>` ==

Not to be used, since not all web hosts support them. Use `<?php ... ?>` instead.

== Indentation ==

Indent code using tabs, not spaces (perhaps some screenshots of settings to change in popular applications - e.g. Notepad++, Scintilla based apps like Programmers Notepad2?)

== Line Termination ==

Use Linux / Unix style line endings (LF)
