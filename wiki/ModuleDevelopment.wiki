A quick guide to making Pixie do more with Modules and Plugins.

=== A Module, a Plugin... what is the difference? ===
----



=== A bit of background ===
----

Not being the strongest developer in the world I always look for the simplest route when coding. I thought it would be a good idea to let you know a little bit about how Pixie works and why it behaves as it does.


=== Setting up your tables ===
----

Throughout this document we will be working on creating a very simple links module. 

The first part of developing your module is creating the database tables. Pixie uses a number of conventions that you must be aware of when creating your table. Lets start with the table name:

  * *Table name*
  The name of your database table is important, it must always start with `pixie_module_` follow by the module name. For our links page example I create a table called `pixie_module_links`.
