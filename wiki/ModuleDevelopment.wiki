A quick guide to making Pixie do more with Modules and Plugins. You will need knowledge of PHP and MySQL to create your own theme, if you are not able to do this the please contact [http://www.toggle.uk.com toggle] who will be happy to quote you for bespoke module development.

=== A Module, a Plugin... what is the difference? ===
----

Post based etc etc.

=== A bit of background ===
----

I thought it would be a good idea to let you know a little bit about how Pixie works and why it behaves as it does. The first thing I need to mention is the URL structure as this forms the basis of how pixie works.

Your site is installed at www.mysite.com... When is visit www.mysite.com/page/ (or www.mysite.com?s=page for those of you without clean URL support) Pixie maps the word "page" to a variable. In this case the variable is `$s`. Pixie supports upto four variables to from the url (www.mysite.com/1/2/3/4) and each one maps to a different variable name:

In this example: www.mysite.com/page/do/something/please/ the URL will be mapped to:

  * `$s` = "page".
  * `$m` = "do".
  * `$x` = "something".
  * `$p` = "here".

`$s, $m, $x and $p` are then available to us within our modules for manipulation. Pixie converts all URL's to lowercase and does not require the last "/" on the end of the URL to work.

 


=== Setting up your tables ===
----

Throughout this document we will be working on creating a very simple links module. 

The first part of developing your module is creating the database tables. Pixie uses a number of conventions that you must be aware of when creating your table. Lets start with the table name:

  * *Table name*
  The name of your database table is important, it must always start with `pixie_module_` follow by the module name. For our links page example I create a table called `pixie_module_links`.

Id name

reserved database field names: url, email, file, image etc etc.


Register your table in `pixie_core`. 

=== Creating the file ===
----
Where to put your file, what to call it and a template for getting started.


=== The links page example ===
----


=== What next? ===
----

This is only a very quick example of what is possible when extending Pixie. We will try and add more examples to this wiki soon. In the mean time why not download some of our other modules and plugins and pick them apart.
